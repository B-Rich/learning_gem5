Some thoughts on this document
------------------------------

* Changes that need to happen before next stable release
   * Remove is_top_level

* We want this document to be living.
   * We should have the source checked in somewhere (probably in a repo next to gem5).
   * We should force people to make updates when they break things.
   * We should have the source for the examples checked into the gem5 repo, and have tests that run them.
